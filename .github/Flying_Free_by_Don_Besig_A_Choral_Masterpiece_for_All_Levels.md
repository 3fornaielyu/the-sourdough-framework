The poem also uses metaphors of birds and wings to symbolize freedom and aspiration.
 
Here are some of the lyrics of the song:

> I saw a bird soar high above the trees
 And wished that I could fly that way
 But I have no wings to lift me from the ground
 And so I watch him fly away
> 
> 
> But then I close my eyes and feel the wind
 And soon I'm soaring through the air
 I have no wings but still I can fly free
 For in my dreams I'm flying there
